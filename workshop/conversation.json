Everywhere I looked, sources repeated the same claims: Western music follows the 12-TET (Twelve-Tone Equal Temperament) system, while Eastern music is different, relying on so-called \"random microtones\" and instruments tuned entirely by ear.\n\nDespite these claims, I wasn’t convinced Eastern music lacked structure. Over years of experimenting by ear—especially while tuning various maqams and scales in my compositions—I began noticing certain patterns in the intervals that brought me particular satisfaction. My software of choice, Csound, gave me the freedom to explore and control the tuning of my digital instruments down to the cent.\n\nThrough countless experiments, one number kept reappearing and pleasing my ear: 75 cents. For context, an octave in music is divided into 1,200 cents. Dividing the octave by 75 cents creates 16 equal steps, or semitones.\n\nEncouraged by this revelation, I started experimenting with 16-TET (Sixteen-Tone Equal Temperament) to play a variety of maqams and Eastern scales. The results felt natural and satisfying—much like the Eastern music I love from Coptic churches, Egyptian composers like Sayed Darwish, and other traditional sources.\n\nAfter years of exploration, I feel confident in saying: for Eastern music, 16 is the new 12.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help with formatting or suggest a title/cover image for your Medium story?"},{"role":"user","content":"tell me your feedback first and your opinion"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Absolutely!

Consider adding concise explanations or analogies—perhaps in footnotes or parentheticals.\n2. **Smoothen Transitions:** Try to make the transitions between ideas a bit smoother. For example, moving from industry claims to your experiments, then to your satisfaction, can be connected with phrases that highlight your thought journey.\n3. **Expand on Impact:** Right now, your discovery is personal. Consider briefly discussing how a 16-TET system could influence musicians globally or how it could modernize or preserve Eastern music traditions.\n4. **End with a Hook or Question:** Engaging the reader to think or act after reading is a powerful way to close. For example, asking how many other hidden patterns await discovery in music.\n\n---\n\n## My Opinion\n\nI genuinely think your story is compelling—both as a personal journey and a technical exploration. This kind of musical detective work is exactly what music communities, especially on platforms like Medium, love to read about. It builds bridges between genres, cultures, and technologies.\n\nIf you refine for clarity and add a touch more invitation for reader engagement, your piece could spark thoughtful conversations—not only among musicians but among people who care about how tradition and technology intersect.\n\n**In short:** Publish it!

After years of trial and error, and careful listening, I realized Eastern music isn’t random or formless—it has its own unique character and internal structure. It’s simply a different way of organizing sound than the Western system. All it took was a fresh way of looking at things.\n\n---\n\n### Giving Voice to My Music\n\nWhat made this new tuning system even more exciting is how it connected with my own instrument—my voice. I’ve always been highly skilled at using my voice to explore melodies, but now, with 16 equal steps, something changed. Suddenly, the music I would sing and improvise by ear became much easier to capture and write down as notes.\n\nComposing wasn’t just a vague feeling anymore. If I moved up the scale with my voice, I could count exactly how many steps I’d taken to get that certain sound or mood. Switching between different maqams—something that used to feel tricky or guesswork—now felt smooth and natural.\n\nWith this approach, music became a clear language for me. It’s not just about tuning, but about being able to express and build music with confidence, using both my ear and my understanding of how the notes fit together.\n\n---\n\n### What If We’re Just Looking at It the Wrong Way?\n\nFor years, I thought there was a secret I simply couldn’t see—a code hidden in the traditional sounds I loved. But it turned out the answer was there all along; I just needed to look past old habits and common assumptions.\n\nNow, I use 16 equal steps per octave in my music, and it feels truthful to what I’m hearing and creating. Maybe it’s time for more people to rethink what gives Eastern music its character—not random microtones, but a different, clear system of its own.\n\nIf you’re making music, or just listening, maybe you’ll hear new possibilities too. Sometimes, when we change the way we measure things, we change what we’re able to understand.\n\n---\n\n### Looking Ahead\n\nNow that I’ve found a system that works, I can't help but wonder what this could mean for other musicians. What if more Eastern musicians started using a shared tuning system like this? Could it make collaboration easier, or bring about new forms of music we haven’t even imagined yet?\n\nI’m also curious if this new approach might help find more common ground between Eastern and Western music—making it easier to mix the two in creative, natural ways. With a clear system, maybe the possibilities for musical connection, conversation, and innovation are just beginning.\n\n---\n\nIf you want Markdown formatting, Medium formatting tips, or have any last tweaks, let me know, yasta!"},{"role":"user","content":"save it to ./draft.md"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I'm going to save the refined story to a new file called `./draft.md` in your current directory.  \nI'll use the layout above, including the headings and spacing, to make it easy for you to use or edit later.\n\nHere’s the command I’ll use:\n\n```bashmo\ncat > ./draft.md <<'EOF'\n# 16 Is the New 12\n\n**Maybe Eastern Music Isn't Really Microtonal After All**\n\n---\n\nMusic has always been one of my passions—but my journey to becoming an algorithmic composer was far from straightforward.
