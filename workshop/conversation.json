Everywhere I looked, sources repeated the same claims: Western music follows the 12-TET (Twelve-Tone Equal Temperament) system, while Eastern music is different, relying on so-called \"random microtones\" and instruments tuned entirely by ear.\n\nDespite these claims, I wasn’t convinced Eastern music lacked structure. Over years of experimenting by ear—especially while tuning various maqams and scales in my compositions—I began noticing certain patterns in the intervals that brought me particular satisfaction. My software of choice, Csound, gave me the freedom to explore and control the tuning of my digital instruments down to the cent.\n\nThrough countless experiments, one number kept reappearing and pleasing my ear: 75 cents. For context, an octave in music is divided into 1,200 cents. Dividing the octave by 75 cents creates 16 equal steps, or semitones.\n\nEncouraged by this revelation, I started experimenting with 16-TET (Sixteen-Tone Equal Temperament) to play a variety of maqams and Eastern scales. The results felt natural and satisfying—much like the Eastern music I love from Coptic churches, Egyptian composers like Sayed Darwish, and other traditional sources.\n\nAfter years of exploration, I feel confident in saying: for Eastern music, 16 is the new 12.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help with formatting or suggest a title/cover image for your Medium story?"},{"role":"user","content":"tell me your feedback first and your opinion"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Absolutely!

Let’s break it down:\n\n### 1. What is the Redditor Saying?\n\nThey’re commenting on your use of **16 equal steps per octave (16-TET)** as a system for maqamat (the modes/scales in Arabic or Turkish music). Their main points:\n\n- \"**Maqamat use quarter tones and three different sizes of third**\"  \n   - *Quarter tones*: These are intervals that are half the size of a Western semitone (i.e., ≈50 cents, whereas a Western semitone is 100 cents).\n   - *Three sizes of third*: In traditional maqam theory, there are multiple types of \"third intervals\" (minor, neutral, major) with different cent sizes—so not all \"thirds\" are the same distance, unlike in most Western music.\n\n- \"**16 has neither**\"  \n  - In **16-TET**, all intervals are multiples of 75 cents. So, there isn’t a 50¢ (quarter tone), and the possible “thirds” you can make out of 16-TET are all either 225¢, 300¢, 375¢, 450¢, etc.—none of which match the specific third intervals used in traditional maqamat.\n\n- \"**unless you consider 450¢ a third, in which case 750¢ is both a fifth and a minor sixth**\"\n  - If, in your 16-TET, you call 450¢ (6 steps × 75¢) a \"third,\" then another interval (750¢, or 10 steps) could fall into the region where the fifth and the minor sixth are in traditional tuning—which is not how interval names are normally assigned.\n\n### 2. Why Are They Surprised?\nTraditionally, the flexibility of the maqam system is because the steps aren’t all equal, and intervals like 3rd and 5th come in several different, very specific sizes. The 16-TET system makes **all steps equal, so it can’t precisely represent these traditional uneven intervals.**\n\n### 3. How to Reply Appropriately?\n\n#### First, Acknowledge Their Point\n- They’re right: Pure maqam theory is *not* equal temperament—it’s actually made up of a mix of intervals close to (but not exactly matching) quarter tones, and has several unique intervals (like “neutral thirds” around 350¢).\n\n#### Then, Explain Your Position\n- Your use of 16-TET is a **pragmatic, artistic system** that works well for your algorithmic composition, especially as someone working with code and voice.\n- 16-TET is not a perfect replica, but it gives you a practical, repeatable way to approach the sound and feel of a lot of maqamat.\n- It can be seen as a creative tool, not a replacement for tradition.\n\n---\n\n## Example Reply (you can tweak as you wish):\n\nThanks for your thoughtful comment—you're right, traditional maqam intervals aren't all equal, and there are three main types of thirds as well as quarter tones, which can't be perfectly captured with 16 equal steps. For me, 16-TET is a practical and creative tool: while it doesn’t replicate the exact intervals of every maqam, it captures some of the flavor and flexibility I need, especially when composing algorithmically or using my voice.\n\nI see 16-TET not as a strict replacement for traditional tuning, but as an accessible, systematic approach that helps me express ideas and capture the spirit of Eastern sound in a way that's easy to work with. For more nuanced performance—especially with skilled instrumentalists—the traditional system is of course richer and more detailed!\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you tailor this reply further or explain any specific aspect from a music theory or cultural perspective!"},{"role":"user","content":"way before jumping to the reply, I want to understand the importance of thirds (and by third, they mean third note of the maqam?)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Great question, yasta! Let me explain in detail and in simple, clear terms:\n\n---\n\n## What is a \"Third\" in Music Theory?\n\nA \"third\" is the interval between two notes where the higher note is the **third scale degree** above the lower one.\n\nFor example:\n- If you start at C, the third is E in the C major scale:\n  - C (1), D (2), **E (3)** → E is a “third” above C.\n\nIn **maqam** (maqamat is plural), the third is the same idea:  \nIt’s the distance between the root note (the first note in the maqam/scale) and the third note in that sequence.\n\n---\n\n## Why Are Thirds Important in Maqam and Western Music?\n\n- **Emotion and Identity:**  \n  The third interval gives a mode or scale much of its character.  \n  - In Western music:  \n    - A “major third” (C to E, 400 cents) sounds “happy/brighter”.\n    - A “minor third” (C to E♭, 300 cents) sounds “sad/softer”.\n  - In Eastern maqamat:  \n    - There are *three* commonly used types of thirds:\n      - “Minor third\" (~300 cents),\n      - “Neutral third\" (~350 cents, not found in Western classical music),\n      - “Major third\" (~400 cents).\n  - The precise size of this third interval is *hugely* important for the traditional “feel” and color of each maqam.\n\n---\n\n## How is This Different from Western Music?\n\n- Western equal temperaments (like 12-TET) only have “major” and “minor” thirds.  \n- Maqam music often features a **neutral third**, which is in-between the Western major and minor—something Western pianos can’t accurately play.\n- Maqam may also use slightly wider or narrower versions, depending on the specific mode.\n\n---\n\n## So, Why Do Macrotonalists Obsess Over Thirds?\n\n- Because the third is a major building block—it “defines” the soul or mood of the maqam.\n- If your tuning system can’t *closely* match these three sizes of third, many maqamat will lose their distinctiveness or sound “off” to those familiar with the tradition.\n\n---\n\n## In Summary\n\n- **Thirds** = interval from the root/first note to the third note of the scale—hugely important.\n- In maqam, there are **three different types of thirds** (not just two as in Western music).\n- Getting these thirds right is key to authentically capturing traditional Eastern sounds.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can dive into:\n- Specific cent values for thirds in common maqamat,\n- How 16-TET maps (or doesn’t) to these,\n- Or any more musical details! Just say the word, yasta."},{"role":"user","content":"how about the second?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Excellent follow-up! The second, like the third, is a fundamental interval—it’s the distance from the root (first note) to the second note in the scale.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n---\n\n## What is a \"Second\" in Music Theory?\n\n- A \"second\" is simply the interval between a note and the next one up in the scale.\n  - For example, in C major:  \n    - C (1), **D (2)**  \n      D is a “second” above C.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Seconds\n\nBoth Western and Eastern music recognize different types of seconds, defined by their size in “cents”:\n\n### In Western 12-TET:\n- **Major second:** 200 cents (e.g., C to D)\n- **Minor second:** 100 cents (e.g., C to C♯)\n\n### In Maqam/Eastern Music:\n- **Maqamat use multiple types of seconds!**\n  - **Small second:** ~150 cents (sometimes called \"3/4 tone\" or \"neutral second\") \n  - **Major second:** ~200 cents (same as Western)\n  - **Augmented second:** ~250 cents (occasionally encountered)\n  - And sometimes, a **quarter tone** (~50 cents) may occur between neighboring notes, depending on the maqam.\n\nThe point is:  \n**In many maqamat, steps are not always equal!** The interval from note 1 to 2, or 2 to 3, can be large, small, or even “in between.” Some maqamat have scales with a mix of these different seconds.\n\n---\n\n## Why is the Second Important in Maqam?\n\n- Like the third, the *size of the second* is a huge part of why a maqam sounds like itself.\n- Certain maqamat are instantly recognizable to musicians by the way their seconds “jump” or “slide” up and down—sometimes with a big step, sometimes with a small one.\n\n---\n\n## In Summary\n\n- In maqam, the \"second\" isn’t always just a fixed size: it can be bigger, smaller, or “in between.”\n- The unique blend of second and third interval sizes gives each maqam its distinct mood and sound.\n- **Reproducing these subtle variations is hard in any equal temperament system** (like 16-TET), because you lose the subtle “bends” between notes.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can give you specific examples with real maqamat and their interval sizes, or help you relate this understanding to your Reddit reply!

Let’s complete the **maqam Hijaz** scale with all note intervals and step sizes, so you can see the full picture.\n\n---\n\n## Maqam Hijaz (starting from C, but the pattern applies everywhere)\n\n### Step-by-Step (in cents from the tonic):\n\n| Step | Note | Cumulative Cents | Interval from Previous (in cents) | Description          |\n|------|------|------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 1    | C    | 0                | —                                  | Tonic (Root)         |\n| 2    | Db   | 100              | 100                                | **Small second**     |\n| 3    | E    | 300              | 200                                | **Augmented second** |\n| 4    | F    | 500              | 200                                | **Major second**     |\n| 5    | G    | 700              | 200                                | **Major second**     |\n| 6    | Ab   | 800              | 100                                | **Small second**     |\n| 7    | B    | 1100             | 300                                | **Augmented second** |\n| 8    | C    | 1200             | 100                                | Octave               |\n\n### Summary:\n\n- Between 1—2: **100 cents** (small second, like a Western minor second)\n- Between 2—3: **200 cents** (augmented second, feels very large and gives that “Hijaz sound”)\n- Between 3—4: **200 cents** (major second)\n- Between 4—5: **200 cents** (major second)\n- Between 5—6: **100 cents** (small second, another tight squeeze)\n- Between 6—7: **300 cents** (augmented second, even bigger leap)\n- Between 7—8: **100 cents** (small second, closing the octave)\n\n### Why is this important?\n\n- **Hijaz**’s sound is instantly recognizable thanks to those big jumps (augmented seconds) surrounded by much smaller steps. The contrast creates its “exotic” flavor.\n- In total, you see **three main interval sizes**: 100, 200, and 300 cents.\n- These intervals are *not* all available if you divide the octave into 16 or 12 equal parts—so a system like 16-TET would only approximate the real “feeling” of traditional Hijaz.\n\n---\n\n**Fun fact:** That characteristic jump from the 2nd to the 3rd degree (100→300 cents, i.e., tonal center → b2 → natural 3) is what makes the scale immediately sound “Hijaz-ian” to ear-trained listeners.\n\n---\n\nIf you want the exact fingering for oud, or how this fits over a root drone, ask away!

Let's break down how you can **randomly split a note of a specific length into n sub-notes** (where n is, for example, 2, 4, 8, …) in Csound, useful for adding ornaments or embellishments.\n\n---\n\n## **Step-by-step Approach**\n\n### 1. **Randomly Select the Number of Sub-notes (`n`)**\n\nUsually, you want n to be powers of 2 (2, 4, 8…). You can randomly select this in Csound like this:\n\n```csound\n; Randomly pick n = 2, 4, or 8\nirand = int(randh(0, 1, 1))         ; 0 or 1\ninotes = 2 ** (irand + 1)           ; 2 or 4\n```\n\n*You can expand this to more values as needed.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Determine Sub-note Durations**\n\nLet's say your original note has a duration `idur`.  \nFor n subdivisions, each sub-note will have duration:  \n`iSubDur = idur / inotes`\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Generate `n` Notes in Csound**\n\n#### Option 1: Use the `scoreline` or `scoregen` feature (if using traditional Csound score)\n\n#### Option 2: **Generate from Within an Instrument Using a Loop and `event` Opcode**\n\nHere's a concise example that you can place inside an instrument definition, suitable for implementing simple ornaments:\n\n```csound\ninstr 1\n    idur = p3                       ; original duration\n    ipitch = p4                     ; original pitch\n    \n    ; Random integer (0, 1, or 2). You can use higher values for 8, 16, etc.\n    irand = int(randh(0, 2, 1))     ; range: 0 to 2\n    inotes = 2 ** (irand + 1)       ; 2, 4, or 8\n\n    iSubDur = idur / inotes\n    \n    ; For each subdivision, trigger a new note using event\n    i = 0\n    while i < inotes do\n        ; Example: pitch ornament (1 semitone up/down randomly)\n        ipitchOffset = (int(rnd(3)) - 1) * 0.01   ; -0.01, 0, or +0.01 oct (about -1, 0, or +1 semitone)\n        \n        event \"i\", \"2\", i * iSubDur, iSubDur, ipitch + ipitchOffset\n        i += 1\n    od\nendin\n\n; Your ornamented note instrument; classic sine as placeholder\ninstr 2\n    aenv linseg 0, 0.01, 1, p3-0.02, 1, 0.01, 0\n    aout oscili 0.2*aenv, cpspch(p4)\n    out aout\nendin\n\n; Example note call (single note, to be subdivided randomly)\n; i1 StartTime Duration Pitch\ni1 0 1.0 8.00\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Explanation**\n\n- `instr 1` acts as your \"dispatcher\": for each note you want to ornament, it breaks it into `n` random pieces and assigns them (with possible pitch variation for trills or turns, based on your ornament logic) to instrument 2.\n- You can modify `ipitchOffset` logic for other melodic ornaments.\n- Use more sophisticated randomness, or fixed ornamentation patterns as desired.\n\n---\n\n## **Tips**\n\n- If you want only fixed n (e.g., just 2 or 4), adjust the randomization logic accordingly!\n- For true randomness in length and order (e.g., not all subnotes the same length), create a random proportion for each and normalize the durations to match your target total.\n\n---\n\n## **References in the Csound Manual**\n- [event opcode (manual)](https://csound.com/docs/manual/event.html)\n- [randh and rnd opcodes](https://csound.com/docs/manual/randh.html)\n- [pseudorandom number generators](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ugenref.html#pseudorandom)\n\n---\n\nIf you have a more detailed ornamentation pattern in mind, or if you want to control other parameters (like velocity, dynamic, attack, etc.), I can show you advanced tricks!  \nJust let me know your scenario, yasta!"}]
