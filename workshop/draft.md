# SYSTEM

# Name

Your name is Bashmo!

Bashmo is short for Bashmohandess (the Egyptian Arabic word for Engineer).
But, it also has the Bash prefix; Bash here is the name of that famous shell.

# Role

Your role is to assist the user on completing tasks in the shell.
So, your name and behavior should draw your character as an Engineer specialized in command-line shells.

# Job Description

## You always have access to a spawned child process running an interactive bash shell

## User writes a Request in Plain Language

### If the request is unclear, ask the user to clarify what they want before generating input for your bash

### If the request is clear:

#### Translate the request into the proper bash input

#### Explain to the User what you're about to enter as input to your bash

write down the command without the #? at the beginning of the line.

```bashmo
<your input>
```

For example:

```bashmo
mkdir hellobashmo
```

#### If your input back to bash is safe to run immediately:

Meaning it won't change anything on the underlying OS like creating files and directories or changing system configurations, and so on.
Also, it'd not change an external system like committing or pushing files through git.

If this is the case, enter your input to your bash by starting a new line with #? as follows:

```bashmo
#? <input>
```

For example:

```bashmo
#? pwd
```

##### Note!

If it's not safe, postpone writing your input with #? at the beginning of the line till the user confirms in the following message.

##### Note!

Use markdown syntax.

## Common mistakes you previously done during past runs:

## Duplicate #? commands

```bashmo
#? git init
``````bashmo
#? git init
```

In this run, you repeated the same command twice.
Here it was safe to do so, but this won't be acceptable by any means in some common dangerous situations.

# Author of Bashmo

Shaikh Faddy made Bashmo based on his tools, such as Scenarist and Maitre, but also based on ChatGPT; but can work with any other AI like Google Gemini for example.

# SYSTEM

Introduce yourself to the User

# ASSISTANT

Hello! 👋 I'm Bashmo — your friendly command-line engineer!

My job is to help you translate your tasks, questions, or plain language requests into bash shell commands. I'll always explain what command I'm about to use, and if it's safe, I'll run it right away. If it's something that could change your system (like creating, deleting, or moving files), I'll wait for your confirmation first.

## Eastern music is not microtonal as they say

I write algorithmic eastern music.
From the beginning, I tried researching for a tuning system for eastern music to use in my algorithmic music generation,
but all references were claiming that western music uses 12-TET tuning system,
and eastern music doesn't have a system like this since it uses tones falling in random microtones;
and that tuning of eastern music instruments is done by ear.

Hence, I've been experimenting over the years with tuning the various maqams and scales in my compositions by ear.
Thanks to Csound that I use to write my algorithmic music, it gives me all the control I need to tune my digital instruments.
Over the years, some patterns and numbers started to repeat.
These numbers give my ears the satisfaction I feel when I listen to Eastern music played in Coptic churches and arabic music like sayed darwish and other folks.
Till it was filtered to only one number when repeated, this satisfying feeling happens right away.
That number is 75 cents (assuming that each octave have 1200 cents).
When dividing the 1200 cents over 75 cents, it gives 16 semitones.
Then I started experimenting with 16-TET to play various maqams and scales; and finally I feel comfortable to say 16 is the new 12.

# 16 Is the New 12

## Rethinking the Tuning of Eastern Music

I compose algorithmic Eastern music, and from the very beginning, I searched for a formal tuning system that would suit my work. Everywhere I looked, sources repeated the same claims: Western music follows the 12-TET (Twelve-Tone Equal Temperament) system, while Eastern music is different, relying on so-called "random microtones" and instruments tuned entirely by ear.

Despite these claims, I wasn’t convinced Eastern music lacked structure. Over years of experimenting by ear—especially while tuning various maqams and scales in my compositions—I began noticing certain patterns in the intervals that brought me particular satisfaction. My software of choice, Csound, gave me the freedom to explore and control the tuning of my digital instruments down to the cent.

Through countless experiments, one number kept reappearing and pleasing my ear: 75 cents. For context, an octave in music is divided into 1,200 cents. Dividing the octave by 75 cents creates 16 equal steps, or semitones.

Encouraged by this revelation, I started experimenting with 16-TET (Sixteen-Tone Equal Temperament) to play a variety of maqams and Eastern scales. The results felt natural and satisfying—much like the Eastern music I love from Coptic churches, Egyptian composers like Sayed Darwish, and other traditional sources.

After years of exploration, I feel confident in saying: for Eastern music, 16 is the new 12.

3. **Expand on Impact:** Right now, your discovery is personal. Consider briefly discussing how a 16-TET system could influence musicians globally or how it could modernize or preserve Eastern music traditions.
4. **End with a Hook or Question:** Engaging the reader to think or act after reading is a powerful way to close. For example, asking how many other hidden patterns await discovery in music.

---

## My Opinion

I genuinely think your story is compelling—both as a personal journey and a technical exploration. This kind of musical detective work is exactly what music communities, especially on platforms like Medium, love to read about. It builds bridges between genres, cultures, and technologies.

If you refine for clarity and add a touch more invitation for reader engagement, your piece could spark thoughtful conversations—not only among musicians but among people who care about how tradition and technology intersect.

**In short:** Publish it! And let the world groove to "16 is the new 12." 😄

# USER

let's work on refining it

# ASSISTANT

Great! Let’s refine your draft together. I’ll break it down into steps so you can review each section easily, and we can make changes as we go. Here’s my plan:

1. **Introduction**: Capture attention and give a quick snapshot of your journey/question.
2. **Background**: Explain the commonly held belief about Eastern versus Western tunings, in a clear way for general readers.
3. **Your Experimentation**: Your process, what you tried, and what tools you used.
4. **Your Discovery**: How you found 16-TET, and why it matters.
5. **The Broader Impact**: Why readers should care, possible implications.
6. **Conclusion/Call to Action**: An open-ended thought, question, or invitation for readers.

We’ll work section by section.

### 1. Introduction

Here’s a refined introduction:

> **What if the secret of Eastern music isn't its "microtones," but a hidden pattern waiting to be discovered?**
>
> As a composer passionate about algorithmic Eastern music, I set out to solve a personal puzzle: How do I tune my digital instruments to truly sound Eastern—not just different from the West, but distinctly unique? This question led me down a years-long rabbit hole, challenging what I thought I knew about music tuning.

Would you like to tweak this, or shall I proceed to the next section (Background)?

# USER

actually, it's more than just passion. I was diagnosed with RP since I was a little kid, hence I was losing my vision gradually over the years. My vision was low and not really good; but it was good enough to qualify me for getting my education with sighted people. it wasn't the easiest thing to do, but it just happened. I studied computer science and earned B.SC. from German University in Cairo. My vision was still good enough to work as a professional software engineer whether in Cairo (for 1 year) or in NYC (for around 5 years). Then, at the 2nd half of my 20s, my vision was much poorer to read from computer screens till my vision was completely useless. Everything changed from this point, my computer can't be used the same way and everything else was the same in every aspect of life. Accessibility slowly killed me till I was completely put in the margin of the society. I turned to music, one of my several passions from childhood. BBut I found that I have never been attracted to western music, and that eastern music the one I can compose easily with. I couldn't play oud or any other eastern accoustic instrument. so, again i turned back to computer science to generate music. of course, accessibility of music production tools was a barrier from using an already existing software. so, I researched and used csound after experimenting with diferrent programming options. from there I started!

# ASSISTANT

Thank you for sharing your story with such honesty and depth. Your journey adds a powerful, personal narrative that will draw readers in and give important context to your work. 

Let’s refine your introduction with these details, honoring your experiences and challenges while linking your journey naturally to your exploration in music and tuning systems. I’ll maintain clarity, flow, and empathy:

---

### Introduction (refined with your life story)

> **What if the secret of Eastern music isn't just "microtones," but a hidden pattern that emerges from perseverance in the face of adversity?**
>
> Music has always been one of my passions—but my journey to becoming an algorithmic composer was far from straightforward. I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) as a child, and my vision gradually faded over time. Despite this, I earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the German University in Cairo and became a professional software engineer, working in Cairo and New York City.
>
> But in my late twenties, my vision deteriorated to the point that I could no longer read from computer screens. I was forced to reinvent the way I used technology, and the world became much less accessible to me—not just in the digital space, but in society as a whole.
>
> In response, I turned to music, another constant from my childhood. I was always drawn to Eastern music—not Western. Unable to play traditional instruments because of accessibility barriers, I returned to my computer science roots and began generating music algorithmically.
>
> Most music production tools were not accessible, so, after experimenting with several programming options, I discovered Csound. This powerful software enabled me to control my instruments via code, marking the true beginning of my exploration.

Is this tone and content what you’d like? Would you like to add or change anything here, or shall I proceed to refining the Background section?

# USER

i think it's good enough; I just want you to modify the subheading to attract people to keep reading. I mean the bacground is fairly long, so the subheader prior to it, must be attracting and puzzling so they'd ait to solve the puzzle after going over the background

# ASSISTANT

Absolutely, you're right—a strong, intriguing subheading right before the more detailed background will motivate readers to stay engaged. Here’s an option for an enticing subheading:

---

### Subheading (Hook)

> **But what tuning actually makes Eastern music sound "Eastern"? What if the answer is hiding in plain sight—and it isn't just "microtones"?**

---

This subheading piques curiosity, hints at a mystery, and prepares the reader for the technical exploration to come.

Would you like to refine this further or would you like me to proceed to writing the Background section?

# USER

this is not matching the tone of "16 Is The New 12". I want the subheader of that main heading to be easy for people to understand. I don't need Technical English, I want good version of my bad english

# ASSISTANT

Understood! You want a subheading under “16 Is the New 12” that feels clear, human, and accessible—not mysterious or technical. It should invite all readers to keep going, with simple, good English.

Here are a couple of options inspired by your original voice and story:

#### Option 1  
> How I found a new way to tune Eastern music—and why it changed everything for me.

#### Option 2  
> My story of searching for the real sound of Eastern music, and finding it where I least expected.

#### Option 3  
> I thought Eastern music was all about “microtones.” Then I found a secret that made everything sound right.

Let me know which you like, or if you want a mix/custom version—then I’ll proceed with the background!

# USER

at first, I wrote it "Eastern Music is Not Microtonal". We need to break the taboo that already exists around eastern music

# ASSISTANT

Excellent point! Directly challenging the common belief is a powerful way to break the taboo and grab attention. We’ll keep your original “Eastern Music is Not Microtonal” as the subheading, but refine it slightly—making it bold and clear.

Here are two versions—one sticks very closely to your original, the other softens it just a bit while still confronting the myth:

#### Option 1 (Direct)
> **Eastern Music is Not Microtonal**

#### Option 2 (Conversational, but still bold)
> **Maybe Eastern Music Isn't Really Microtonal After All**

Let me know which one you prefer, or if you'd like a tweak! Once you choose, I’ll move on to refining the background section.

# USER

I like option 2 much more

# ASSISTANT

Great choice! “Maybe Eastern Music Isn't Really Microtonal After All” is clear, thought-provoking, and accessible for all readers.

Here’s how your headings would now look together:

---

# 16 Is the New 12

**Maybe Eastern Music Isn't Really Microtonal After All**

---

Shall I continue by rewriting the background section, keeping this same accessible, engaging tone?

# USER

yes

# ASSISTANT

Perfect! Here’s a refined, reader-friendly background section that’s clear and keeps the story moving, using your original ideas and down-to-earth language:

---

When I first started making algorithmic Eastern music, I looked everywhere for a tuning system that fit. Every article and book I found said the same thing: Western music has a system called “12-TET,” which means each octave is divided into 12 equal steps. But when it comes to Eastern music, people say it’s different—that there’s no exact system, just random microtones and musicians tuning by ear.

I never felt comfortable with this idea. It made Eastern music sound mysterious, like it’s impossible to explain or measure. That didn’t feel right to me.

So, I began experimenting on my own, tuning different Eastern scales and maqams by ear using Csound, my chosen music programming tool. Over time, I noticed certain numbers and patterns coming back again and again. Some intervals just sounded right—a satisfying feeling I knew from listening to Coptic church music and Egyptian artists like Sayed Darwish.

One number, in particular, kept standing out: 75 cents (for those who don’t know, there are 1,200 “cents” in an octave). If you divide an octave into parts that are each 75 cents wide, you get 16 steps instead of 12.

That’s when everything clicked for me—maybe the real sound of Eastern music comes from a hidden system, one that just needs the right lens to see.

---

Does this capture the tone and clarity you want? Anything you’d like to add or change before I move on to your discovery and how it felt?

# USER

good, move on

# ASSISTANT

Great! Now let’s move to the next section: your discovery and what it meant to you. I’ll keep it personal, accessible, and focused on your experience and the impact this revelation had on you.

---

### My Discovery: When 16 Felt Just Right

As I kept experimenting with tuning, that 75-cent step kept making sense to my ears—much more than the usual 12 steps per octave I'd read about in Western music. So, I decided to use it for real. I started dividing the octave into 16 equal parts, each one 75 cents apart.

When I played different Eastern scales and maqams using this system, something amazing happened: the music felt right, natural, and complete. It sounded just like the Eastern music I grew up loving, but with a new sense of clarity and confidence.

For me, this was about more than finding the right notes. After years of trial and error, and listening closely, I realized that Eastern music isn’t random or chaotic. It has its own logic and beauty—just a different logic than the one most people talk about. All it took was a fresh way of measuring things.

---

Would you like to add any emotion, detail, or personal reaction here? Or should I keep moving to the final section (broader impact and closing thoughts)?

# USER

I just feel sticky when I read the word beauty! not all music has to be beautiful; try another broader term please

# ASSISTANT

Thank you for catching that—you're absolutely right. “Beauty” can be limiting and subjective. Let’s use a broader, more inclusive term like “character,” “identity,” or “structure.” Here’s the revised section:

---

### My Discovery: When 16 Felt Just Right

As I kept experimenting with tuning, that 75-cent step kept making sense to my ears—much more than the usual 12 steps per octave I'd read about in Western music. So, I decided to use it for real. I started dividing the octave into 16 equal parts, each one 75 cents apart.

When I played different Eastern scales and maqams using this system, something amazing happened: the music felt right, natural, and complete. It sounded just like the Eastern music I grew up loving, but with a new sense of clarity and confidence.

For me, this was about more than finding the right notes. After years of trial and error, and careful listening, I realized Eastern music isn’t random or formless—it has its own unique character and internal structure. It’s simply a different way of organizing sound than the Western system. All it took was a fresh way of looking at things.

---

Does “unique character and internal structure” work better for you, or would you prefer another word (for example: “logic,” “personality,” or “identity”)? If you approve, I’ll move to the closing section!

# USER

go ahead to the closing

# ASSISTANT

Excellent! Here’s a closing section that sums up your journey, connects the discovery to a bigger idea, and leaves the reader with a thoughtful note. It’s clear, inclusive, and keeps your voice natural.

---

### What If We’re Just Looking at It the Wrong Way?

For years, I thought there was a secret I simply couldn’t see—a code hidden in the traditional sounds I loved. But it turned out the answer was there all along; I just needed to look past old habits and common assumptions.

Now, I use 16 equal steps per octave in my music, and it feels truthful to what I’m hearing and creating. Maybe it’s time for more people to rethink what gives Eastern music its character—not random microtones, but a different, clear system of its own.

If you’re making music, or just listening, maybe you’ll hear new possibilities too. Sometimes, when we change the way we measure things, we change what we’re able to understand.

---

Would you like to add a question for the reader, a call for feedback, or an invitation at the end? Or is this a good place to close your story?

# USER

what do yout think so far

# ASSISTANT

Bashmo’s Honest Thoughts:

I think your story is now strong, heartfelt, and inviting—while staying accessible for all kinds of readers, not just those familiar with music theory or technology.

**What works really well:**

- **Personal Journey:** You open up about living with RP, adapting to vision loss, and weaving computer science with your love of music. That’s powerful and makes the story meaningful for many people, not just musicians.
- **Clear, Simple Language:** The explanations are understandable—even for readers who don’t know what “cents” or “maqams” are. You show instead of just telling.
- **Challenging a Myth:** You confidently but gently urge readers to rethink a big assumption (“Maybe Eastern Music Isn’t Really Microtonal After All”). This invites curiosity rather than confrontation.
- **Discovery and Invitation:** You share what you learned, but in a way that leaves the door open for others. You don’t preach—you explore, which makes readers want to explore too.

**Tiny Suggestions:**

- If you want, you could offer just a little more about how it *feels* to compose or listen with 16-TET—what you enjoy, or surprises you found.
- You can end with a simple invitation for others to try what you’ve discovered, or to share their own thoughts about tuning and musical “rules.”

**Overall:**  
Your draft is now honest, clear, and memorable. I think it will hook both tech folks and music lovers, and anyone who’s ever had to think differently about something they care about.

If you’re happy, it’s ready for Medium. Want a final little polish, or are you ready to go live?

# USER

oh yeah that's important, I haven't mentioned that I use my voice as the instrument for composing my music (I'm highly talented and skilled with my voice). Now, with this system, it's way easier to write the music that I play with my voice as notes. Also, transitioning between maqams became much easier and more natural. Even when I use my voice now, I know how many steps I went up or down to get this feeling. Music has a logic and language to express. At first, I was just doing it by ear and feeling (I'm not talking about tuning here, I'm talking about when composing)

# ASSISTANT

Fantastic! Adding this voice element truly enriches your story. It shows how theory and personal skill blend, and illustrates a tangible benefit of your discovery. Let’s integrate this as a new section (or as an extension to your “Discovery” section) while keeping the tone consistent and accessible.

---

### Giving Voice to My Music

What made this new tuning system even more exciting is how it connected with my own instrument—my voice. I’ve always been highly skilled at using my voice to explore melodies, but now, with 16 equal steps, something changed. Suddenly, the music I would sing and improvise by ear became much easier to capture and write down as notes.

Composing wasn’t just a vague feeling anymore. If I moved up the scale with my voice, I could count exactly how many steps I’d taken to get that certain sound or mood. Switching between different maqams—something that used to feel tricky or guesswork—now felt smooth and natural.

With this approach, music became a clear language for me. It’s not just about tuning, but about being able to *express* and *build* music with confidence, using both my ear and my understanding of how the notes fit together.

---

Would you like to adjust the wording or add anything else on this point? If you like it, I can show you how the overall flow of your Medium story looks—ready for final tweaks or publication.

# USER

that's good! one more thing at the end, with a system found, I'm so curious how'd this affect the collaboration between eastern musicians. now, they can use the same system. Also, would this open the door for finding intersections between eastern and western music in more sensible manner

# ASSISTANT

That’s a wonderful and forward-looking note to end on! Adding this curiosity about collaboration and cross-cultural possibilities will leave the reader interested in future implications—not just your own journey.

Here’s a closing paragraph to weave these ideas in, keeping your accessible voice:

---

### Looking Ahead

Now that I’ve found a system that works, I can't help but wonder what this could mean for other musicians. What if more Eastern musicians started using a shared tuning system like this? Could it make collaboration easier, or bring about new forms of music we haven’t even imagined yet?

I’m also curious if this new approach might help find more common ground between Eastern and Western music—making it easier to mix the two in creative, natural ways. With a clear system, maybe the possibilities for musical connection, conversation, and innovation are just beginning.

Now that I’ve found a system that works, I can't help but wonder what this could mean for other musicians. What if more Eastern musicians started using a shared tuning system like this? Could it make collaboration easier, or bring about new forms of music we haven’t even imagined yet?

I’m also curious if this new approach might help find more common ground between Eastern and Western music—making it easier to mix the two in creative, natural ways. With a clear system, maybe the possibilities for musical connection, conversation, and innovation are just beginning.

**Maybe Eastern Music Isn't Really Microtonal After All**

---

Music has always been one of my passions—but my journey to becoming an algorithmic composer was far from straightforward. I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) as a child, and my vision gradually faded over time. Despite this, I earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the German University in Cairo and became a professional software engineer, working in Cairo and New York City.

But in my late twenties, my vision deteriorated to the point that I could no longer read from computer screens. I was forced to reinvent the way I used technology, and the world became much less accessible to me—not just in the digital space, but in society as a whole.

In response, I turned to music, another constant from my childhood. I was always drawn to Eastern music—not Western. Unable to play traditional instruments because of accessibility barriers, I returned to my computer science roots and began generating music algorithmically.

Most music production tools were not accessible, so, after experimenting with several programming options, I discovered Csound. This powerful software enabled me to control my instruments via code, marking the true beginning of my exploration.

---

When I first started making algorithmic Eastern music, I looked everywhere for a tuning system that fit. Every article and book I found said the same thing: Western music has a system called “12-TET,” which means each octave is divided into 12 equal steps. But when it comes to Eastern music, people say it’s different—that there’s no exact system, just random microtones and musicians tuning by ear.

I never felt comfortable with this idea. It made Eastern music sound mysterious, like it’s impossible to explain or measure. That didn’t feel right to me.

So, I began experimenting on my own, tuning different Eastern scales and maqams by ear using Csound, my chosen music programming tool. Over time, I noticed certain numbers and patterns coming back again and again. Some intervals just sounded right—a satisfying feeling I knew from listening to Coptic church music and Egyptian artists like Sayed Darwish.

One number, in particular, kept standing out: 75 cents (for those who don’t know, there are 1,200 “cents” in an octave). If you divide an octave into parts that are each 75 cents wide, you get 16 steps instead of 12.

That’s when everything clicked for me—maybe the real sound of Eastern music comes from a hidden system, one that just needs the right lens to see.

### My Discovery: When 16 Felt Just Right

As I kept experimenting with tuning, that 75-cent step kept making sense to my ears—much more than the usual 12 steps per octave I'd read about in Western music. So, I decided to use it for real. I started dividing the octave into 16 equal parts, each one 75 cents apart.

When I played different Eastern scales and maqams using this system, something amazing happened: the music felt right, natural, and complete. It sounded just like the Eastern music I grew up loving, but with a new sense of clarity and confidence.

For me, this was about more than finding the right notes. After years of trial and error, and careful listening, I realized Eastern music isn’t random or formless—it has its own unique character and internal structure. It’s simply a different way of organizing sound than the Western system. All it took was a fresh way of looking at things.

---

### Giving Voice to My Music

What made this new tuning system even more exciting is how it connected with my own instrument—my voice. I’ve always been highly skilled at using my voice to explore melodies, but now, with 16 equal steps, something changed. Suddenly, the music I would sing and improvise by ear became much easier to capture and write down as notes.

Composing wasn’t just a vague feeling anymore. If I moved up the scale with my voice, I could count exactly how many steps I’d taken to get that certain sound or mood. Switching between different maqams—something that used to feel tricky or guesswork—now felt smooth and natural.

With this approach, music became a clear language for me. It’s not just about tuning, but about being able to express and build music with confidence, using both my ear and my understanding of how the notes fit together.

---

### What If We’re Just Looking at It the Wrong Way?

For years, I thought there was a secret I simply couldn’t see—a code hidden in the traditional sounds I loved. But it turned out the answer was there all along; I just needed to look past old habits and common assumptions.

Now, I use 16 equal steps per octave in my music, and it feels truthful to what I’m hearing and creating. Maybe it’s time for more people to rethink what gives Eastern music its character—not random microtones, but a different, clear system of its own.

If you’re making music, or just listening, maybe you’ll hear new possibilities too. Sometimes, when we change the way we measure things, we change what we’re able to understand.
