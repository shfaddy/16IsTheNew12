# 16 is the new 12

## Eastern music is not microtonal as they say

I write algorithmic eastern music.
From the beginning, I tried researching for a tuning system for eastern music to use in my algorithmic music generation,
but all references were claiming that western music uses 12-TET tuning system,
and eastern music doesn't have a system like this since it uses tones falling in random microtones;
and that tuning of eastern music instruments is done by ear.

Hence, I've been experimenting over the years with tuning the various maqams and scales in my compositions by ear.
Thanks to Csound that I use to write my algorithmic music, it gives me all the control I need to tune my digital instruments.
Over the years, some patterns and numbers started to repeat.
These numbers give my ears the satisfaction I feel when I listen to Eastern music played in Coptic churches and arabic music like sayed darwish and other folks.
Till it was filtered to only one number when repeated, this satisfying feeling happens right away.
That number is 75 cents (assuming that each octave have 1200 cents).
When dividing the 1200 cents over 75 cents, it gives 16 semitones.
Then I started experimenting with 16-TET to play various maqams and scales; and finally I feel comfortable to say 16 is the new 12.
