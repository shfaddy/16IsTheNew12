# 16 Is the New 12

## Maybe Eastern Music Isn't Really Microtonal After All!

### My Story: Rediscovering Music Through Adversity

Music has always been one of my passions—but my journey to becoming an algorithmic composer was far from straightforward. I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) as a child, and my vision gradually faded over time. Despite this, I earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the German University in Cairo and became a professional software engineer, working in Cairo and New York City.

But in my late twenties, my vision deteriorated to the point that I could no longer read from computer screens. I was forced to reinvent the way I used technology, and the world became much less accessible to me—not just in the digital space, but in society as a whole.

In response, I turned to music, another constant from my childhood. I was always drawn to Eastern music—not Western. Unable to play traditional instruments because of accessibility barriers, I returned to my computer science roots and began generating music algorithmically.

Most music production tools were not accessible, so, after experimenting with several programming options, I discovered Csound. This powerful software enabled me to control my instruments via code, marking the true beginning of my exploration.

### Questioning the Myths of Eastern Music

When I first started making algorithmic Eastern music, I looked everywhere for a tuning system that fit. Every article and book I found said the same thing: Western music has a system called “12-TET,” which means each octave is divided into 12 equal steps. These 12 tones make all Western scales easily accessible—you just choose the right
notes from the set of twelve to create any scale you need.

But for Eastern music, people say it’s different—that there’s no clear system, just random microtones and musicians tuning by ear. So, instead of having one set of notes
for all the maqams, I had to retune everything each time I wanted to play a different maqam or scale—there was no shared structure.

I never felt comfortable with this idea. It made Eastern music sound mysterious, like it’s impossible to explain or measure. That didn’t feel right to me.

There have been famous attempts to solve this: some musicians suggested dividing the octave into 24 semitones, by simply splitting each of the 12 semitones in two (these
are often called “quarter tones”). But this system never satisfied my ears. Mathematically, it always felt like the easy way out: if 12 tones aren’t enough and we need something in between, just divide by 2! But I kept asking myself, why use 12 as the starting point for Eastern music at all? That’s the number for Western music—it doesn’t
mean the right number for Eastern music must be related to 12 in such a simple way.

So, I began experimenting on my own, tuning different Eastern scales and maqams by ear using Csound, my chosen music programming tool. Over time, I noticed certain numbers and patterns coming back again and again. Some intervals just sounded right—a satisfying feeling I knew from listening to Coptic church music and Egyptian artists like
Sayed Darwish.

One number, in particular, kept standing out: 75 cents (for those who don’t know, there are 1,200 “cents” in an octave). If you divide an octave into parts that are each
75 cents wide, you get 16 steps instead of 12.

That’s when everything clicked for me—maybe the real sound of Eastern music comes from a hidden system, one that just needs the right lens to see.

### My Discovery: When 16 Felt Just Right

As I kept experimenting with tuning, that 75-cent step kept making sense to my ears—much more than the usual 12 steps per octave I'd read about in Western music. So, I decided to use it for real. I started dividing the octave into 16 equal parts, each one 75 cents apart.

When I played different Eastern scales and maqams using this system, something amazing happened: the music felt right, natural, and complete. It sounded just like the Eastern music I grew up loving, but with a new sense of clarity and confidence.

For me, this was about more than finding the right notes. After years of trial and error, and careful listening, I realized Eastern music isn’t random or formless—it has
its own unique character and internal structure. It’s simply a different way of organizing sound than the Western system. All it took was a fresh way of looking at things.

### Giving Voice to My Music

What made this new tuning system even more exciting is how it connected with my own instrument—my voice. I’ve always been highly skilled at using my voice to explore melodies, but now, with 16 equal steps, something changed. Suddenly, the music I would sing and improvise by ear became much easier to capture and write down as notes.

Composing wasn’t just a vague feeling anymore. If I moved up the scale with my voice, I could count exactly how many steps I’d taken to get that certain sound or mood. Switching between different maqams—something that used to feel tricky or guesswork—now felt smooth and natural.

With this approach, music became a clear language for me. It’s not just about tuning, but about being able to express and build music with confidence, using both my ear and my understanding of how the notes fit together.

### What If We’re Just Looking at It the Wrong Way?

For years, I thought there was a secret I simply couldn’t see—a code hidden in the traditional sounds I loved. But it turned out the answer was there all along; I just needed to look past old habits and common assumptions.

Now, I use 16 equal steps per octave in my music, and it feels truthful to what I’m hearing and creating. Maybe it’s time for more people to rethink what gives Eastern music its character—not random microtones, but a different, clear system of its own.

If you’re making music, or just listening, maybe you’ll hear new possibilities too. Sometimes, when we change the way we measure things, we change what we’re able to understand.

### Looking Ahead: Collaboration and New Musical Connections

Now that I’ve found a system that works, I can't help but wonder what this could mean for other musicians. What if more Eastern musicians started using a shared tuning system like this? Could it make collaboration easier, or bring about new forms of music we haven’t even imagined yet?

I’m also curious if this new approach might help find more common ground between Eastern and Western music—making it easier to mix the two in creative, natural ways. With a clear system, maybe the possibilities for musical connection, conversation, and innovation are just beginning.
